### Below is only for solutions not the csv.reader() section
### constant value multiplication is not counted in as final complexity

### Task0
7 entry printed, each O(1) since the index is clear , 7* O(1) => O(1)

### Task1
2 for loops each O(n); set O(n) worse case =>  3*O(n) => O(n)

### Task2
1 for loop each O(n), 1 set O(n) worse and 1 sorted O(n log n)  => since records are more than 20 then is worse O(n log n)

### Task3
3 for loops each O(n), 1 sorted O(n log n) => since records are more than 20 then is worse O(n log n)

### Task4
3 for loops each O(n), 4 set O(n) worse, 3 union each ~O(len(s)) s<<n, 1 difference O(len(s)) s<<n, 1 sorted O(n log n) => O(n log n)
